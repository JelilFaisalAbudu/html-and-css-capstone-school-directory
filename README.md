## Additional description about the project and its features.

SchoolHub is a web app developed to help parents and guardians find schools with ease for their wards.

For this reason, the home has a large search field for the user to enter the school he or she is looking for.
However, the user has another option to click on a navigation icon on the navbar to open a list of registered schools.

Another feature of the web app is the ability of the user to apply for admission directly from the page.
